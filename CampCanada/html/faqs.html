        <h3 class="question">
          WHY SHOULD I GO THROUGH CAMP CANADA ?
          <div class="plus-minus-toggle collapsed"></div>
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">With AmeriCamp Canada you are not just a number – you’re the newest member of our ever growing family!
          We want to offer you the very best service and most importantly the best summer camp Canada experience of a lifetime.
          Now enough from us, hit ‘play’ and see what Jenna got up to during her time in Canada which includes Niagara Falls!</div>

      <li>
        <h3 class="question">
          WHEN DO I HAVE TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ?
          <div class="plus-minus-toggle collapsed"></div>
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">Most camps have a 9-week contract starting in the last two weeks of June.
          We can only accept applications with availability up to the 24th of June 2018.
          If you can’t start until after this date please contact the office to discuss your options.
          The earlier you are available the better; camps start hiring for some positions from late May, so if you do work longer than 9 weeks (11 weeks for a day camp) you will get paid a daily rate on top of your initial salary.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 class="question">
          WHERE DO I HAVE TO GO FOR AN INTERVIEW ?
          <div class="plus-minus-toggle collapsed"></div>
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">Interviews can be conducted in our Manchester HQ or (more commonly) face-to-face in your hometown or university campus, carried out by our Campus Managers. In exceptional circumstances, we can conduct your interview via Skype.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 class="question">
          WHAT IS THE PROGRAM FEE FOR ?
          <div class="plus-minus-toggle collapsed"></div>
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">The program fee covers your application fee, i.e. the cost of us working with you to make sure that your application is submitted to and processed by the US office, to get you placed at your perfect camp!
          It also includes the work that goes into preparing your work permit, which allows you to work and earn money legally in Canada, your placement, and comprehensive medical insurance</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 class="question">
          HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GET PLACED ?
          <div class="plus-minus-toggle collapsed"></div>
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">There is no exact amount of time it takes to get placed, although generally speaking the earlier you apply, the earlier you will be placed.
          It is definitely worth making a note of the dates of our AmeriCamp Canada Camp Fairs held in January, as here you have an excellent chance to secure your placement on the spot!
          Don’t worry if you can’t attend, though, as our placement coordinator will be working through the year to match you with your perfect camp.
          Please also be aware that placements can occur anytime up to the 30th of June, so hold tight and keep the faith!</div>
