      The Positions<br><br>

      There are three positions you can apply for at a Camp in Canada. They are 
      general camp counselor, activities camp counselor and support staff. While
      the counselor positions are the most popular and have you working closely
      with the children, all positions need you to be highly energetic and
      outgoing. Theses positions are great opportunities to boost your skills,
      add international work to your CV and to immerse yourself in the Canadian
      culture.<br><br>

      The Application Process<br><br>

      Applying to Camp Canada is quite simple and throughout the process we are
      there to help you through. If you have any questions along the way one of
      our staff members are always ready and willing to answer them.<br><br>

      Stage One: Application and Interview<br><br>

      To apply to the programme you’ll need to make the first stage payment for
      £69, this shows commitment to the programme and covers the cost of the
      interview.. Once this payment is made, you’ll receive an application. After
      you have complete your application and returned it back to the team, we’ll
      review your application and, if you are a rockstar on paper, invite you to
      do an interview with either a member of staff or your local campus manager.
      These interviews are informal, but informative meetings that allow us to get
      to know you and your skills better so that we can ensure you have the strongest
      application possible and that we have the correct information about you to
      match you up with the right camp.<br><br>

      Stage Two: Documentation<br><br>

      Once the interview is done you will have 14 days to submit the rest of
      your application, 3 references and a short application video. This is how
      the Camp Directors in Canada will get to know what kind of person you are
      on a personal level so make sure you talk about your skills in your video
      and include a few photos of you doing them. The references cannot be from
      friends or family members and must contain active contact details so we can
      verify them. Teachers, employers or coaches are the best references to fill
      out the forms.<br><br>

      Stage Three: Placement and Visa<br><br>

      This part of the process is when we work hard to match you with the best
      camp for you and then get you prepared to make your way to Canada. You will
      either be placed through our system or at one of our Camp Fairs. These fairs
      are great opportunities to have more control over the camp you will be
      placed at and have the possibility to be placed with a friend. At these
      fairs you will meet face to face with the Camp Directors and show off your
      amazing personality and brag about your skills. Once you have been placed
      it is now time to make your final payment, get your medical and visa and
      book your flights. You do NOT have to attend an embassy interview to obtain
      your visa. Visas are done online and you get it when you go through customs
      in Canada. Flights are quite easy too and we can get you in contact with our
      flight partner to help you book them. It is best to apply early so you can
      get placed earlier, book flights earlier and get a cheaper rate.
